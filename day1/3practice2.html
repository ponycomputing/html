<h1>Olympics Introduction</h1>

<h2>Ancient Olympic Games</h2>

<p>The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years 
    at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece.</p>

<p>Competition was among representatives of several city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece.</p>


<h2>Modern Games</h2>

<p>Various uses of the term "Olympic" to describe athletic events in the modern era have been documented 
    since the 17th century.</p>

<p>The first such event was the Cotswold Games or "Cotswold Olimpick Games", an annual meeting near 
    Chipping Campden, England, involving various sports.</p>

<h2>International Olympic Committee</h2>

<h3>Under national organising committees</h3>

<p>The Olympic Games have been commercialised to various degrees since the inaugural 1896 Summer 
    Olympics in Athens, when a number of companies paid for advertising, including Kodak.
    In 1908, Oxo, Odol mouthwash, and Indian Foot Powder became official sponsors of the 
    London Olympic Games.</p>

<p>Before the IOC took control of sponsorship, the NOCs had responsibility for negotiating their 
    own contracts for sponsorship and use of the Olympic symbols.</p>

<h3>Under IOC control</h3>

<p>The IOC originally resisted funding by corporate sponsors.</p>

<p>It was not until the retirement of IOC President Avery Brundage, in 1972, 
    that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and 
    the lucrative advertising markets available to them.</p>
